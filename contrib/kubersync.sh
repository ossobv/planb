#
# kubersync is an example rsync wrapper that will backup filesystems
# available to Kubernetes, like rook.io cephfs volumes.
#
# It works like this:
# - you install a single k8s pod that gets the rook/ceph mounts;
# - this k8s pod has access to the mount points, and has the rsync binary
# - the pod does nothing but sleep;
# - until we exec into it, when we want to rsync.
#
# So, instead of calling:
# - /usr/bin/rsync --server --sender ...
# we'll do:
# - kubectl exec -it MOUNT_POD -- rsync --server --sender ...
#
# That way, we have access to K8S managed mounts, if we give those
# mounts to the MOUNT_POD.
#
# Setting it up:
#
# - choose a host with a working kubectl and access to K8s;
# - configure a 'remotebackup' user on that host (for ssh access);
# - give that user sudo powers to /usr/local/bin/kubersync:
#   > # The backup user needs to access the MOUNT_POD.
#   > remotebackup ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/kubersync --server --sender *
# - setup/configure the deployment below, adding/changing rook/ceph
#   paths as needed;
# - calling "/usr/local/bin/kubersync deploy" once, to install the
#   MOUNT_POD;
# - configure the PlanB fileset, with Rync-transport:
#   * select the hostname/IP
#   * include *only* the /cephfs-nvme1 path
#   * set the 'remotebackup' user
#   * sudo
#   * change rsync-path to /usr/local/bin/kubersync
#
# That should be sufficient to get things up and running.


# Namespace where the 'backup-mount' pod is expected to run.
namespace=backup
label=app=sleepy-mount


# Quick and easy deployment. You may need to tweak this. Run this once,
# or whenever you're changing K8s storage volumes. This installs a pod that:
# - mounts the relevant volume
# - installs rsync
# - does nothing but sleep (but allows PlanB to exec to it an rsync from there)
